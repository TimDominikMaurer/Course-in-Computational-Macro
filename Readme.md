# A Course in Computational Macroeconomics

By [Frederik Bjørn Christensen](https://www.cbs.dk/en/research/departments-and-centres/department-of-economics/staff/fbceco) and [Tim Dominik Maurer](https://www.timdominikmaurer.com/).

Short Description
---------------------
* Lecture 1: A Deterministic General-Equilibrium Life-cycle Model
	* This lecture numerically solves a deterministic multiperiod overlapping-generations model in general equilibrium.
	* In excerise 1 you are asked to introduce a pension scheme to the model (Solutions are provided).
* Lecture 2: Dynamic Transition Path
	* This lecture solve for the transition path from a pre to a post-shock steady state.
	* We consider an MIT-policy-shock that introduces a pension scheme.
* Lecture 3: A Partial-Equilibrium Life-cycle Model with Income Risk
	* This lecture solves and simulates a life-cycle model with income risk in partial equilibrium using backward induction.
* Lecture 4: The Endogenous Grid Method
	* This lecture solves the model in Lecture 3 using the more efficient Endogenous Grid Method.

COURSE PREREQUISITES
---------------------
There are no formal prerequisites for this course. However, a basic understanding of the following topics is helpful:
 * Microeconomics and macroeconomics theory and modelling
 * Programming concepts: Data types (e.g. strings, booleans, integers and floats), Data containers (e.g. lists, dicts and arrays), Conditional statements (if-elseif-else), Loops (for, while), (Pseudo) random numbers
 * Numerical optimization
